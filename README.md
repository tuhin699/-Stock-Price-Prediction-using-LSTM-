## Introduction

In this project, we utilize LSTM neural networks, a powerful architecture for time-series data, to predict stock prices. By combining historical stock price data and LSTM models, we aim to develop accurate and reliable predictive models that can assist in making informed investment decisions.

## Key Features

- **LSTM Modeling:** Learn about the fundamentals of LSTM networks and how they can be effectively applied to time-series prediction problems in the stock market.

- **Data Preprocessing:** Understand the essential steps of preprocessing raw stock market data, handling missing values, and engineering features for training and evaluation.

- **Model Training:** Explore various LSTM configurations, experiment with hyperparameters, and discover techniques to enhance model performance and convergence.

- **Evaluation and Visualization:** Dive into the evaluation metrics used to assess model predictions and visualize the model's performance against actual stock price movements.

- **Deployment Considerations:** Gain insights into deploying stock price prediction models in real-world scenarios, including latency, model updates, and risk management.
